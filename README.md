# Plato-s-Pizza-Maven-Challenge-Analysis
The goal is to craft data stories by analyzing data and addressing important questions, such as the busiest days and times, the amount of pizzas made during peak periods, best-selling and worst-selling pizzas, average order value, and how well the seating capacity is being utilized. Join me in this opportunity to turn data into actionable insights and help Plato's Pizza succeed!

**Key Analysis:**
How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?
How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?
How much money did we make this year? Can we identify any seasonality in the sales?
Are there any pizzas we should take off the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?

**Call to Action:**
Digitalize pizza Sales: Restaurants can leverage technology to help customers place orders even when indoors. This will help improve the order output in Quarter 4 as well as overall revenue.
Upsell Pizzas: Increase the average spend of each customer per order by offering irresistible promotions that encourage customers to buy more quantity on purchase.
Make Holidays Count: Since more than 50% of the holidays promise more orders than the average orders per day, the holiday season is a good day to get busy but also generate more revenue
Black Pizza Day: Looks like our Customers would like Pizzas cheap. offer more sales and revenue-generating offers on Black Friday.
Peak Days: Lunch hours (12-13) on weekdays need us be at our best work efficiency. Prioritize workers' shift in these hours as well as evening periods (16-19) for every other day.
Table Optimization: To effectively evaluate the table optimization, we need to collect sitting data including party size per order, time, and potentially, seats occupied.
